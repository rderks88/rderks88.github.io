He is a real all-rounder and easily switches between concept, UI/UX-design, frontend and backend. What makes Rob unique is that he is both capable of the hands-on technical realisation of a project, as well as abstract conceptual thinking. In this, he never loses sight of the needs of the end-user or the ultimate business goals. Furthermore Rob is a really pleasant person to work with and is able to effortlessly adapt to various work processes."

      "content": "<b>Why</b><br>During my time at Yubu I made a difference for high school students. After making the ‘wrong’ choice for my own study, I figured that was a domain in which a thing or two could be improved. With Yubu we proved that that was both necessary and possible.<br><br><b>How</b><br>We started out with three founders. Guus Meijer, Kees Meershoek and myself. We started out as a small start-up and learned from the mistakes that you are supposed to make during this fase. Some knowledge we trained ourselves in, like dev-ops (Scrum). Other fields such as scalability and robustness of software purchased knowledge whereas in this case we had me privately schooled to perform on top-level. During this process I got code-tutored by `We Are Builders` (a successfull start-up studio from Rotterdam).<br><br><b>What</b><br>My responsibilities included the technical side of the product development, as well as the shared responsibility for strategic choices.<br>The success of our start-up we attribute to the focus on the end-user (the student) in our design-process. We built software and serious games, tailored to their needs. Students liked the fact that our product was actually designed for them instead of for the ‘study-choice counselors’.<br>During our investment rounds and during the selling of our business I got to learn from some experienced investors which gave me insight in some higher level business-strategies. All in all, the time spent working on Yubu made me the business savvy programmer I am today."
